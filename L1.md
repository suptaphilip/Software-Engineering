> ## Chapter 1: The Nature of Software
##### Definition of Software
Software is: 
> * (1) instructions (computer programs) that when executed provide de- sired features, function, and performance;
> * (2) data structures that enable the pro- grams to adequately manipulate information, and 
> * (3)descriptive information in both hard copy and virtual forms that describes the operation and use of the programs.

##### Software Application Domains
There are seven broad categories of computer software and continuing challenges for software engineers:
1. System software
2. Application software
3. Engineering/scientific software
4. Embedded software
5. Product-line software
6. Web/Mobile applications
7. Artificial intelligence software

##### Legacy Software
The older programs(software)—often referred to as legacy softwar is very difficult to maintenance and changes.
###### Four broad categories of software are evolving to dominate the industry.
* ###### WebApps
> WebApps have evolved into sophisticated computing tools that not only provide stand-alone function to the end user, but also have been integrated with corporate databases and business applications.
* ###### Mobile Applications
> The term app has evolved to connote software that has been specifically de- signed to reside on a mobile platform (e.g., iOS, Android, or Windows Mobile).
* ###### Cloud Computing
> Cloud computing encompasses an infrastructure or “ecosystem” that enables any user, anywhere, to use a computing device to share computing resources on a broad scale.

> ## Chapter 2: Software Engineering

##### Definition of Software Engineering
Software Engineering : 
(1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.
(2) The study of approaches as in (1).
##### software engineering layers
* Software engineering is a layered technology.
* Software engineering must rest on an organizational commitment to quality.
* The foundation for software engineering is the process layer.
* Process defines a framework that must be established for effective delivery of software engineering technology.
* Software engineering methods provide the technical how-to’s for building software; a broad array of tasks that include communication, requirements analysis, design modeling, program construction, testing, and support.
* Software engineering tools provide automated or semi-automated support for the process and the methods.

##### software Engineering Process
* A process is a collection of activities, actions, and tasks that are performed when some work product is to be created.
> The Process Framework
* A process framework establishes the foundation for a complete software engineering process by identifying a small number of framework activities
    > Communication
    > Planning
    > Modeling
    > Construction
    > Deployment
##### Software Engineering Umbrella Activities
* Software engineering process framework activities are complemented by a number of umbrella activities.
*  In general, umbrella activities are applied throughout a software project and help a software team manage and control progress, quality, change, and risk.
    > Software project tracking and control
    > Risk management
    > Software quality assurance
    > Technical reviews
    > Measurement
    > Software configuration management
    > Reusability management
    > Work product preparation and production
##### Software Engineering Pratice
1. Understand the problem (communication and analysis).
2. Plan a solution (modeling and software design).
3. Carry out the plan (code generation).
4. Examine the result for accuracy (testing and quality assurance).

##### Software Engineering General Principles
* The First Principle: The Reason It All Exists
* The Second Principle: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!)
* The Third Principle: Maintain the Vision
* The Fourth Principle: What You Produce, Others Will Consume
* The Fifth Principle: Be Open to the Future
* The Sixth Principle: Plan Ahead for Reuse
* The Seventh Principle: Think!
